                    Before joining PALMYRA, Jack worked as a metal fabricator in Portland, Oregon, where he designed and built custom architectural elements. He also worked as a carpenter and woodworker in Upstate New York (Buffalo and Albany), designing and renovating various spaces – including a late nineteenth-century residence in South Buffalo, a 1960’s horse trailer as a pop-up store, commercial retail environments, and other residential projects. He also had a brief stint as a carpenter for a homestead in Lecce, Italy, focusing primarily on low-budget construction and the use of recycled material.

At the University of Oregon his research focused on the health, diversification, and revitalization of urban cores through increased transparency in craft, manufacturing, and industrial practices – particularly in underutilized urban spaces and through the reuse of waste materials.
